Joint project of Josh Devecka (amd3th/jdev19) and John-Michael Glenn (Valrix).

This is a very simple Bukkit plugin to send user and time data to a database
for storage until the data is later pulled to be displayed however you desire.
Our method is to send the data when the user joins and create a small data file
so when they do something it updates the file until they hit a set number of
actions or the timed update event fires which updates everyone's data and
stores it to the database.

Feel free to use the code however you'd like and compile the plugin yourself
if you want. Just please leave us some credit if you continue to build upon
the plugin. It did take a while and was our first time learning Java. Thanks.
