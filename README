Joint project of Josh Devecka and John-Michael Glenn.

This is a very simple Bukkit plugin to send user and time data to a database
for storage until the data is later pulled to be displayed however you desire.
Our method is to send the date upon joining and quitting a server and
calculating how long the user has been on as well as seeing if they are still
connected. This is a basic way to track your users and see who's been on, how
long they've been on, when they were last on, as well as seeing how many users
are currently online and since the data is stored in a database you can easily
view the data on the web.

Feel free to use the code however you'd like and compile the plugin yourself
if you want. Just please leave us some credit if you continue to build upon
the plugin. It did take a while and was our first time learning Java. Thanks.
